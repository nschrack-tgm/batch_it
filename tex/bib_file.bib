  abstract = {Motivation / Background
	
	
	The domain of automation industry is characterised by a highly proprietary
	environment. Different platforms and different tools are in use.
	In most cases there is no interoperability between different solutions
	of different vendors. The standard IEC 61131-3 provides a very small
	basis for common modelling of control programs, but platforms and
	tools are not able to interoperate. Several steps to improve this
	situation have been undertaken by the PLCopen. The new standard IEC
	61499 has even more ambitious objectives. These can be described
	by the three issues portability, configurability, and interoperability:
	
	
	Portability: the ability of software tools to accept and correctly
	interpret library elements produced by other software tools.
	
	Configurability: the ability of devices and their software components
	to be configured (selected, assigned locations, interconnected and
	parameterized) by multiple software tools.
	
	Interoperability: the ability of devices from different vendors operating
	together to perform the functions specified by one or more distributed
	applications.
	
	A look at the current status of the developments in the domain of
	the IEC 61499 standard and its related implementations show, that
	these targets are not fully achieved so far. As a conclusion a common
	and public available basis for the further evloution and extension
	of the IEC 61499 standard is needed to achieve the above mentioned
	challenging objectives.},

	about and dynamically integrate the appropriate knowledge and services

	Language (DAML) program have been actively involved in furthering
	this trend. The dynamic integration of knowledge and services depends
	on the existence of explicit declarative semantic models (ontologies).
	DAML is an emerging language for specifying machine-readable ontologies
	on the web. DAML was designed to support tractable reasoning. We
	have been developing tools for developing ontologies in the Unified
	Modeling Language (UML) and generating DAML. This allows the many
	mature UML tools, models and expertise to be applied to knowledge
	representation systems, not only for visualizing complex ontologies
	but also for managing the ontology development process. Furthermore,
	UML has many features, such as profiles, global modularity and extension
	mechanisms that have yet to be considered in DAML. Our paper identifies
	the similarities and differences (with examples) between UML and
	DAML. To reconcile these differences, we propose a modest extension
	to the UML infrastructure for one of the most problematic differences.
	This is the DAML concept of property which is a first-class modeling
	element in DAML, while UML associations are not. For example, a DAML
	property can have more than one domain class. Our proposal is backward-compatible
	with existing UML models while enhancing its viability for ontology
	modeling. While we have focused on DAML in our research and development
	activities, the same issues apply to many of the knowledge representation
	languages. This is especially the case for semantic network and concept
	graph approaches to knowledge representations.},

	major focus has been given to the implementation of holonic control
	into the small to medium size manufacturing enterprises (SMEs).
	
	The virtual holonic factory concept has been introduced, as a test
	bed for integration of a holonic control into a virtual factory,
	i.e. three-dimensional VR model of a factory in order to visually
	realize the effects of holonic control, when implemented to a real
	manufacturing system.
	
	A case study has been carried out in a medium size die-casting manufacturing
	plant. Through the virtual factory, a holonic control architecture
	for flow-line manufacturing system has been implemented for dynamic
	scheduling of machines in the medium size factory in order to achieve
	robustness necessary to handle the disturbances. The system performance
	and key attributes of the holonic control, such as re-configurability

  abstract = {The real-time control system (RCS) methodology has evolved over a
	number of years as a technique to capture task knowledge and organize
	it in a framework conducive to implementation in computer control
	systems. The fundamental premise of this methodology is that the
	present state of the task activities sets the context that identifies
	the requirements for all the support processing. In particular, the
	task context at any time determines what is to be sensed in the world,
	what world model states are to be evaluated, which situations are
	to be analyzed, what plans should be invoked, and which behavior
	generation knowledge is to be accessed. This results in a methodology
	that concentrates first and foremost on the task definition. It starts
	with the definition of the task knowledge in the form of a decision
	tree that clearly represents the branching of tasks into layers of
	simpler and simpler subtask sequences. This task decomposition framework
	is then used to guide the search for and to emplace all of the additional
	knowledge. This paper explores this process in some detail, showing
	how this knowledge is represented in a task context-sensitive relationship
	that supports the very complex real-time processing the computer
	control systems will have to do.},

	distinct structures for shop floor control are considered, namely,
	hierarchical, heterarchical and holonic control systems. Holonic
	manufacturing is a novel paradigm for manufacturing that tries to
	merge the best properties of both hierarchical and heterarchical
	systems, namely, a high and predictable performance with a high robustness
	against disturbances. The paper identifies the concept of hierarchy
	in distributed shop floor control as one of the key contributions
	of holonic manufacturing. In a holonic architecture, the mapping
	of functions to control units remains flexible, such that decision
	power can be distributed over these units as needed. Based on the
	invariants concept of computer science, a modelling framework is
	proposed to identify the decision making needs of each unit. It can
	be used not only to describe the behaviour of the system, but also
	to impose performance and operational guarantees.},

	When intelligence is approached in an incremental manner, with strict

	our approach to incrementally building complete intelligent Creatures.
	The fundamental decomposition of the intelligent system is not into
	independent information processing units which must interface with
	each other via representations. Instead, the intelligent system is
	decomposed into independent and parallel activity producers which
	all interface directly to the world through perception and action,
	rather than interface to each other particularly much. The notions
	of central and peripheral systems evaporateeverything is both central
	and peripheral. Based on these principles we have built a very successful
	series of mobile robots which operate without supervision as Creatures
	in standard office environments. },

	blurring of the lines between the manufacturing and service industries.
	The authors identify ten strategic technology areas as the most important
	for research and development and they recommend ways to address crosscutting
	questions. Representing a variety of industries, the authors identify
	six grand challenges that must be overcome for their vision to be
	realized, including the human/technology interface, environmental
	concerns, and {miniaturization.A} host of issues are discussed that
	will push and pull at manufacturing over the next 20 years: the changing
	workforce, the changing consumer, the rise of bio- and nanotechnology,
	the prospects for waste-free processing, simulation and modeling
	as design tools, shifts in global competition, and much {more.The}
	information and analyses in this book will be vitally important to
	everyone concerned about the future of manufacturing: policymakers,
	executives, design and engineering professionals, researchers, faculty,
	and students.},

	development strategy, it offers broader product ranges, shorter model
	lifetimes and the ability to process orders in arbitrary lot sizes.
	This offers the ability to conduct early product design and development

	the axioms defining them. We add bridging axioms not only as bridges
	between terms in two related ontologies but also to make this merge
	into a complete new ontology for further merging with other ontologies.
	Translation is implemented using an inference engine ( OntoEngine
	), running in either a demand-driven (backward-chaining) or data-driven
	(forward chaining) mode. We illustrate our method by describing its
	application in an online ontology translation system, OntoMerge ,
	which translates a dataset in the DAML notation to a new DAML dataset
	that captures the same information, but in a different ontology.
	A uniform internal representation, Web-PDDL is used for representing
	merged ontologies and datasets for automated reasoning.},

	with no support from the ground. We are already in the process of
	building a platform (RISCbot II) which consists of a comprehensive
	sensor suite and significant end-effector capabilities for manipulation.
	In order to reduce the uncertainty in localization, sensor fusion
	is used to create an efficient and effective user interface to facilitate
	teleoperation by enhancing the quality of information that is provided
	to the teleoperator. We are developing a framework for a modular
	design of sensory modules, actuation platforms, and task descriptions
	that will be implemented as a tool to reduce and streamline efforts
	in designing robotic platforms. The framework is comprised of three
	modules. The first module encapsulates the sensors which gather information
	about the remote, or local, environment. The second module defines
	the platforms and actuation methods. The last module describes the
	tasks that the platforms will perform such as teleoperation, navigation,
	obstacle avoidance, manipulation, 3-D reconstruction, and map building.
	This paper presents the modular design process of the RISCbot II
	mobile manipulator. In the design process, the overall design of
	the system is discussed and then the control process of the robot
	is presented. Furthermore, the tasks that the RISCbot II can perform

	a bank for a loan . why lowering prices below production costs can
	be a smart move . and much more. It's easy to see that much of Ford's

  abstract = {The build-to-order supply chain management (BOSC) strategy has recently
	attracted the attention of both researchers and practitioners, given
	its successful implementation in many companies including Dell computers,
	Compaq, and BMW. The growing number of articles on BOSC in the literature
	is an indication of the importance of the strategy and of its role
	in improving the competitiveness of an organization. The objective
	of a BOSC strategy is to meet the requirements of individual customers
	by leveraging the advantages of outsourcing and information technology.
	There are not many research articles that provide an overview of
	BOSC, despite the fact that this strategy is being promoted as the
	operations paradigm of the future. The main objective of this research
	is to (i) review the concepts of BOSC, (ii) develop definitions of
	BOSC, (iii) classify the literature based on a suitable classification
	scheme, leading to some useful insights into BOSC and some future
	research directions, (iv) review the selected articles on BOSC for
	their contribution to the development and operations of BOSC, (v)
	develop a framework for BOSC, and (vi) suggest some future research
	directions. The literature has been reviewed based on the following
	four major areas of decision-making: organizational competitiveness,
	the development and implementation of BOSC, the operations of BOSC,
	and information technology in BOSC. Some of the important observations
	are: (a) there is a lack of adequate research on the design and control
	of BOSC, (b) there is a need for further research on the implementation
	of BOSC, (c) human resource issues in BOSC have been ignored, (d)
	issues of product commonality and modularity from the perspective
	of partnership or supplier development require further attention
	and (e) the trade-off between responsiveness and the cost of logistics
	needs further study. The paper ends with concluding remarks.},

  abstract = {tests for common values at first-price sealed-bid auctions. Our tests
	are nonparametric, require observation only of the bids submitted
	at each auction, and are based on the fact that the winner's curse'
	arises only in common values auctions. The tests build on recently
	developed methods for using observed bids to estimate each bidder's
	conditional expectation of the value of winning the auction. Equilibrium
	behavior implies that in a private values auction these expectations
	are invariant to the number of opponents each bidder faces, while
	with common values they are decreasing in the number of opponents.
	This distinction forms the basis of our tests. We consider both exogenous
	and endogenous variation in the number of bidders. Monte Carlo experiments
	show that our tests can perform well in samples of moderate sizes.
	We apply our tests to two different types of {U.S.} Forest Service
	timber auctions. For unit-price ( scaled') sales often argued to
	fit a private values model, our tests consistently fail to find evidence
	of common values. For lumpsum' sales, where a priori arguments for
	common values appear stronger, our tests yield mixed evidence against
	the private values {hypothesis.Institutional} subscribers to the

	Trends in the oil and gas industry to improve safety and efficiency
	and reduce environmental impact suggest the use of industrial robotics.
	New developments in regions difficult or dangerous for humans to
	work in could be enabled with maintenance, inspection and repairs
	carried out by remotely-controlled industrial robots. This new application
	area highlights some difficulties with today's robots, as they do
	not adapt well to dynamic environments, do not offer rich human-robot
	interaction and are not simple for end-users to program. In addition,
	the oil and gas context presents a challenging work environment for
	robots as they are exposed to variable and often extreme weather
	and need to be safe for use alongside explosive hydrocarbons. As
	robots are introduced, issues of trust and accountability come to
	the fore as well as how they fit into organisational structures.
	If robots have too little autonomy, human operators will waste time
	attending to robots instead of attending to their work tasks. If
	robots are highly autonomous, situational awareness of plant activity
	is diminished. A balance needs to be struck to find a level of autonomy
	suitable for the task, the realistic capabilities of the automation,
	and the need to actively engage human operators in a constructive
	fashion. These issues also relate to what form the interface takes
	for remote or co-located robot control, as well as how information
	and activity is represented for remote operators. The contribution
	of this paper is a discussion of issues relating to human-robot interaction

	games for Microsoft's Xbox gaming console. The revenue equivalence
	theorem states that any auction form having the same effective reserve
	price yields the same expected revenue. The effective reserve price
	on {eBay} consists of three components: the opening bid amount, the
	secret reserve amount, and the shipping and handling charge to keep
	the overall reserve level fixed. We set no secret reserve price and
	varied the opening bid and the shipping and handling charge to keep
	the overall reserve level fixed. When the effective reserve was \$4,
	auctions with a low opening bid and high shipping charges attracted
	more bidders, earlier bidding, and yielded higher revenue than those
	with a high opening bid and low shipping charges. The same results
	hold only for Xbox games under the \$8 effective reserve. Unlike
	the other treatments, where the reserve represents less than 30\%
	of the retail price of the item, for {CDs,} the \$8 effective reserve
	represents over 50\% of the retail price of the item. In this treatment,
	we find no systematic difference in the number of bidders attracted
	to the auction or revenues as a function of how the effective reserve
	is allocated between opening bid and shipping charges. We show that
	these results can be accounted for by bounded-rational bidding behavior.},

	own aims and objectives. Relevant exemplars include the Web, Grid
	Computing, Peer-to-Peer systems, Sensor Networks, Cloud Computing,
	Pervasive Computing and many eCommerce applications. Now, although
	these areas have somewhat different areas of emphasis, we believe
	they can all be viewed as operating under the same conceptual model.
	Namely, one in which: (i) entities offer a variety of services in
	some form of institutional setting; (ii) other entities connect to
	these services (covering issues such as service discovery, service
	composition and service procurement); and (iii) entities enact services,
	subject to service agreements, in a flexible and context sensitive
	manner. Moreover, we believe agent-based computing, with its emphasis
	on autonomous, flexible action and interaction, is an appropriate
	computational model for conceptualizing, designing and implementing
	such systems [12, 13]. In particular, such agents are a naturalway
	of viewing flexible service providers and consumers that need both
	to respond to environmental change, while being able to work towards
	their individual and collective aims. Moreover, the interactions
	between these agents need to take place in some form of electronic
	institution that structures the interactions and can provide an effective
	matching of the appropriate producers and consumers. Everyday examples
	of such institutionsmight include: eBay, Second Life, Betfair exchanges

	will focus specifically on trading institutions and in particular

  abstract = {Electronic commerce {(EC)} is an industrial revolution that many industry
	and academic observers believe will transform the conduct of business
	and the structure of the marketplace. At the heart of the changes
	are a number of economic forces that will shape the manner in which
	goods and services are defined. They will also affect how new technologies
	are used by firms for strategic advantage, how firms organize themselves
	to compete in a changing marketplace, how the new electronic markets
	develop, and how the economy as a whole is impacted. In this article,
	we review these and other developments from the perspective of economic
	analysis in the context of the emerging research literature on {EC.}
	Our coverage in this survey spans the fields of Information Systems
	{(IS)}, Computer Science {(CS)}, Economics, Finance, Marketing and
	other relevant areas, where new and interesting work on information
	technology {(IT)} and {EC} on the Internet are rapidly developing.
	Our goals are threefold. (1) We identify the range of applicable
	theory and current research at a number of different conceptual levels
	of analysis in {EC} research. (2) We offer an assessment of the state-of-the-art
	of knowledge about {EC} phenomena in terms of the conceptual levels
	of analysis. (3) We chart the directions along which some of the
	most interesting work is likely to develop. This research will provide
	the stimulus for researchers from {IS}, our reference discipline,
	and other fields in schools of business and management to recognize
	that research in the area of {EC} is business school research, broadly
	defined. As such, one can expect to see developments in this research
	area in the next several years across multiple disciplines.},

  abstract = {To realize a truly collaborative product design and development process,
	effective communication among design collaborators is a must. In
	other words, the design intent that is imposed in a product design
	should be seized and interpreted properly; heterogeneous modeling
	terms should be semantically processed both by design collaborators
	and intelligent systems. Ontologies in the Semantic Web can explicitly
	represent semantics and promote integrated and consistent access
	to data and services. Thus, if an ontology is used in a heterogeneous
	and distributed design collaboration, it will explicitly and persistently
	represent engineering relations that are imposed in an assembly design.
	Design intent can be captured by reasoning, and, in turn, as reasoned
	facts, it can be propagated and shared with design collaborators.
	This paper presents a new paradigm of ontology-based assembly design.
	In the framework, an assembly design (AsD) ontology serves as a formal,
	explicit specification of assembly design so that it makes assembly
	knowledge both machine-interpretable and to be shared. An Assembly
	Relation Model (ARM) is enhanced using ontologies that represent
	engineering, spatial, assembly, and joining relations of assembly
	in a way that promotes collaborative assembly information-sharing
	environments. In the developed AsD ontology, implicit AsD constraints
	are explicitly represented using OWL (Web Ontology Language) and
	SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language). This paper shows that the ability
	of the AsD ontology to be reasoned can capture both assembly and
	joining intents by a demonstration with a realistic mechanical assembly.
	Finally, this paper presents a new assembly design information-sharing
	framework and an assembly design browser for a collaborative product
	development.},

  abstract = {The Semantic Web realization depends on the availability of a critical
	mass of metadata for the web content, associated with the respective
	formal knowledge about the world. We claim that the Semantic Web,
	at its current stage of development, is in a state of a critical
	need of metadata generation and usage schemata that are specific,
	well-defined and easy to understand. This paper introduces our vision
	for a holistic architecture for semantic annotation, indexing, and
	retrieval of documents with regard to extensive semantic repositories.
	A system (called KIM), implementing this concept, is presented in
	brief and it is used for the purposes of evaluation and demonstration.
	
	A particular schema for semantic annotation with respect to real-world
	entities is proposed. The underlying philosophy is that a practical
	semantic annotation is impossible without some particular knowledge
	modelling commitments. Our understanding is that a system for such
	semantic annotation should be based upon a simple model of real-world
	entity classes, complemented with extensive instance knowledge. To
	ensure the efficiency, ease of sharing, and reusability of the metadata,
	we introduce an upper-level ontology (of about 250 classes and 100
	properties), which starts with some basic philosophical distinctions
	and then goes down to the most common entity types (people, companies,
	cities, etc.). Thus it encodes many of the domain-independent commonsense
	concepts and allows straightforward domain-specific extensions. On
	the basis of the ontology, a large-scale knowledge base of entity
	descriptions is bootstrapped, and further extended and maintained.
	Currently, the knowledge bases usually scales between 105 and 106
	descriptions.
	
	Finally, this paper presents a semantically enhanced information extraction
	system, which provides automatic semantic annotation with references
	to classes in the ontology and to instances. The system has been
	running over a continuously growing document collection (currently
	about 0.5 million news articles), so it has been under constant testing
	and evaluation for some time now. On the basis of these semantic
	annotations, we perform semantic based indexing and retrieval where
	users can mix traditional information retrieval (IR) queries and
	ontology-based ones. We argue that such large-scale, fully automatic
	methods are essential for the transformation of the current largely
	textual web into a Semantic Web.},

  abstract = {The concrete tools manufacturing enterprises need to thrive in today's
	global environment For a manufacturing enterprise to succeed in this
	current volatile economic environment, a revolution is needed in
	restructuring its three main components: product design, manufacturing,
	and business model. The Global Manufacturing Revolution is the first
	book to focus on these issues. Based on the author's long-standing
	course work at the University of Michigan, this unique volume proposes
	new technologies and new business strategies that can increase an
	enterprise's speed of responsiveness to volatile markets, as well
	as enhance the integration of its own engineering and business. Introduced
	here are innovations to the entire manufacturing culture: An original
	approach to the analysis of manufacturing paradigms Suggested methods
	for developing creativity in product design A quantitative analysis
	of manufacturing system configurations A new manufacturing "reconfigurable"
	paradigm, in which the speed of responsiveness is the prime business
	goal An original approach to using information technology for workforce
	empowerment The book also offers analysis and original models of
	previous manufacturing paradigms' technical and business dimensions-including
	mass production and mass customization-in order to fully explain
	the current revolution in global manufacturing enterprises. In addition,
	200 original illustrations and pictures help to clarify the topics.
	Globalization is creating both opportunities and challenges for companies
	that manufacture durable goods. The tools, theories, and case studies
	in this volume will be invaluable to engineers pursuing leadership
	careers in the manufacturing industry, as well as to leaders of global
	enterprises and business students who are motivated to lead manufacturing
	enterprises and ensure their growth.},

	namely the move from a local economy towards a global and competitive
	economy, with markets demanding for highly customized products of
	high quality at lower costs, and with short life cycles. In this
	environment, manufacturing enterprises, to remain competitive, must
	respond closely to customer demands by improving their flexibility
	and agility, while maintaining their productivity and quality. Dynamic
	response to emergence is becoming a key issue in manufacturing field
	because traditional manufacturing control systems are built upon
	rigid control architectures, which cannot respond efficiently and
	effectively to dynamic change. In these circumstances, the current
	challenge is to develop manufacturing control systems that exhibit
	intelligence, robustness and adaptation to the environment changes

	the advantages of modularity, decentralization, autonomy, scalability
	and re-usability. This paper surveys the literature in manufacturing
	control systems using distributed artificial intelligence techniques,

	The paper also discusses the reasons for the weak adoption of these

  abstract = {{"The} mass production of standardized goods was the source of America's
	economic strength for generations. But in today's turbulent business
	environment mass production no longer works; in fact, it has become
	a major cause of the nation's declining competitiveness. As Joseph
	Pine makes clear, the most innovative companies are rapidly embracing
	a new paradigm of management - mass customization - that allows them
	the freedom to create greater variety and individuality in their
	products and services at desirable prices." {"New} ways of managing,
	together with new technology, enable savvy businesses to provide
	each customer with the attractive "tailor-made" benefits of the pre-industrial
	craft system at the low costs of modern mass production. Companies
	that have discovered and successfully implemented mass customization
	are swiftly outpacing their competitors in gaining new customers
	and achieving higher margins. Among the firms that are leading their
	industries to this new frontier are {McGraw-Hill}, which can deliver
	custom-made classroom textbooks in quantities under 100 copies; Motorola,
	which can manufacture any one of 29 million variations of pagers
	within twenty minutes after receipt of order; and {TWA} Getaway Vacations,
	which offers custom-designed tours at the same price that others
	charge for standardized group tour packages." {"Pine} explains mass
	customization in its historical context. He reviews the history of
	production in America, demonstrates why mass production cannot work
	in industries experiencing upheaval, and outlines how new forms of
	competition have led to greater variety and customization. Based
	upon academic and field research, his work is a thoughtful analysis
	and commentary on when and how managers in both service and manufacturing
	industries can make the crucial transition to mass customization.
	He details the strategies, methods, and organizational transformations
	required to develop, produce, market, and deliver individually customized
	goods and services, and he shows managers how to analyze their own
	industries to determine if they should shift to mass customization."
	{"The} term "mass customization" was coined by Stan Davis in his
	1987 book, Future Perfect. Joseph Pine has documented its place in
	the continuum of industrial development and mapped out the management
	implications for firms that decide to adopt it."--{BOOK} {JACKET.}},

  abstract = { Joining collaborations and maintaining relationships has become a
	major concern for managers in industrial companies. This change,
	to a large extent, arises due to the globalization of markets and
	the ongoing specialization of companies, fostered by the possibilities
	of information technology and data-communication. However, such a
	structural change requires adaptations by companies to fit the characteristics
	of industrial collaborations. In particular, the increasing complexity
	of collaborations in highly dynamic environments oftentimes is underestimated.
	This paper demonstrates an approach to cope with this increasing
	complexity and to find an adequatenot necessarily minimumlevel
	of complexity by the application of principles of complex systems
	from various sciences to industrial collaborations, considered as
	socio-technical systems. The industrial relevance of this research
	approach is illustrated through the example of the tool and die industry.

	allowing readers to develop a repertoire of useful techniques that
	goes beyond the single-minded current fads. Examines the ways in
	which architectural issues can impact software design; shows how
	to design new systems in principled ways using well-understood architectural
	paradigms; emphasizes informal descriptions, touching lightly on
	formal notations and specifications, and the tools that support them;
	explains how to understand and evaluate the design of existing software

  abstract = {Manufacturing process planning is the process of selecting and sequencing
	manufacturing processes such that they achieve one or more goals
	and satisfy a set of domain constraints. Manufacturing scheduling
	is the process of selecting a process plan and assigning manufacturing
	resources for specific time periods to the set of manufacturing processes
	in the plan. It is, in fact, an optimization process by which limited
	manufacturing resources are allocated over time among parallel and
	sequential activities. Manufacturing process planning and scheduling
	are usually considered to be two separate and distinct phases. Traditional
	optimization approaches to these problems do not consider the constraints
	of both domains simultaneously and result in suboptimal solutions.
	Without considering real-time machine workloads and shop floor dynamics,
	process plans may become suboptimal or even invalid at the time of
	execution. Therefore, there is a need for the integration of manufacturing
	process-planning and scheduling systems for generating more realistic
	and effective plans. After describing the complexity of the manufacturing
	process-planning and scheduling problems, this paper reviews the
	research literature on manufacturing process planning, scheduling
	as well as their integration, particularly on agent-based approaches
	to these difficult problems. Major issues in these research areas
	are discussed, and research opportunities and challenges are identified},

	PN-based methods appealing in real-time scheduling and control of

	diagram of an FMS and develop a heuristic rule-base to solve the
	resource contention problem then formulate the dynamic behavior of
	the system by high-level PNs. The modeling methodology is illustrated
	by an FMS, and the proposed rule-based system is compared with several

  abstract = {Motiviert durch die in Theorie und Praxis verbreitete Diskussion ?ber
	die F?hrung von Unternehmensnetzwerken und zwischenbetrieblichen
	Kooperationen greift die Arbeit die Forschungsfrage nach den bei
	Gestaltung, Lenkung und Weiterentwicklung von gef?hrten Unternehmensnetzwerken
	zu ber?cksichtigenden Dimensionen des Managements auf. Als Aufgabe
	der Summe aller Managementfunktionen wird hierbei die Sicherung der
	Lebensf?higkeit im Sinne des nachhaltigen Gesch?ftserfolges gef?hrter
	Unternehmensnetzwerke verstanden. Die Antwort auf die formulierte
	Forschungsfrage bildet die Herleitung eines integrierten Managementkonzeptes,
	welches es dem Anwender als Gestalter und Lenker von Unternehmensnetzwerken
	erm?glicht, alle notwendigen und hinreichenden Aspekte der Aus?bung
	einer integrierten Managementfunktion zu ber?cksichtigen und eine
	ganzheitliche Sichtweise auf das zu lenkende System einzunehmen.Hierzu
	wurde in den ersten beiden Kapiteln die Notwendigkeit einer integrierten
	Sichtweise des Managements auf gef?hrten Unternehmensnetzwerken und
	Kooperationen aufgezeigt sowie die wissenschaftlichen und erkenntnistheoretischen
	Grundlagen f?r die Gestaltung des L?sungsraumes geschaffen. Anhand
	eines heuristischen Bezugsrahmens wurden alle relevanten ?berlegungen
	dargelegt und diskutiert, die in Verbindung mit einer systemorientierten
	Sichtweise einen Beitrag zur Ableitung der in der Arbeit dokumentierten
	Ergebnisse zum Erkenntnisobjekt ?gef?hrtes Unternehmensnetzwerk?
	leisteten. Im dritten Kapitel wurde entlang dem Modell des allgemeinen
	Regelkreises ein ?berblick ?ber den Stand der Forschung zur Erkl?rung
	und Gestaltung der beiden wesentlichen Systemkomponenten ?Regelstrecke?
	als Unternehmensnetzwerk und Kooperation, sowie ?Regler? im Sinne
	von Managementkonzepten und Modellierungsans?tzen zur Gestaltung,
	Lenkung und Entwicklung von Unternehmensnetzwerken und Kooperationen
	gegeben. Darauf aufbauend wurden im vierten Kapitel die Anforderungen
	an ein integriertes Managementkonzept aus Sicht produzierender Unternehmen
	der Branchen Maschinen- und Anlagenbau sowie Werkzeug- und Formenbau
	als Einzelauftragsfertiger er?rtert und f?r die weitere Forschungsarbeit
	festgeschrieben. Basierend hierauf wurde in Kapitel 5 ein Konzept
	des Managements in gef?hrten Unternehmensnetzwerken entwickelt, welches
	in ein generisches Beschreibungsmodell und einen daran ankn?pfenden
	Handlungsrahmen unterteilt ist. Es zeichnet sich dadurch aus, dass
	es ganzheitlich sowohl die gestalterischen und lenkenden Funktionen
	innerhalb des potenzialwirksamen Netzwerkes als auch die das Probleml?sungspotenzial
	erschlie?enden Ma?nahmen und Abläufe einer aktivierten Kooperation
	ber?cksichtigt. Im Vordergrund stand hierbei die Gew?hrleistung der
	zur Lebensf?higkeit im Sinne von Stafford Beers Viable System Model
	erforderlichen Grundfunktionen des Managements. Abschlie?end wurden
	die gewonnnen Erkenntnisse in Kapitel 6 an f?nf Fallbeispielen validiert.
	Hierbei wurden in den einzelnen Fällen jeweils verschiedene Aspekte
	des Konzeptes auf ihre Anwendbarkeit bewertet. Einerseits wurde die
	Top-down Netzwerkgestaltung eines international agierenden Unternehmens
	mit verschieden weltweiten Standorten diskutiert, andererseits wurde
	die Bottom-up Gestaltung und Lenkung von KMU-Netzwerken und Kooperationen
	behandelt. Die Ergebnisse der Fallstudien belegen, dass sich das
	erarbeitete Konzept eignet, um die wesentlichen F?hrungsaspekte des
	Zielobjektes Unternehmensnetzwerk bzw. Kooperation abzubilden und

	an internal representation (world model) of entities, events and

	inattentional amnesia has implications for our views on the content

	held in the longer term with dynamically perceived sense data. This
	includes implications for the type of formalisms we employ and for
	ontology. Importantly, in the case of the latter, evidence for the
	micro-structure of natural vision indicates that ontological description
	should perhaps be (task-related) feature-oriented, rather than object-oriented.
	These issues are discussed in the context of existing work in developing
	autonomous agents for a simulated driving world. The view is presented
	that the reliability of represented knowledge guides information
	seeking and perhaps explains why some things get ignored.},

  abstract = {Supplier selection is a multi-criteria decision making problem which
	includes both qualitative and quantitative factors. In order to select
	the best suppliers it is necessary to make a trade-off between these
	tangible and intangible factors some of which may conflict. When
	business volume discounts exist, this problem becomes more complicated
	as, in these circumstances, buyer should decide about two problems:
	which suppliers are the best and how much should be purchased from
	each selected supplier. In this article an integrated approach of
	analytical hierarchy process improved by rough sets theory and multi-objective
	mixed integer programming is proposed to simultaneously determine
	the number of suppliers to employ and the order quantity allocated
	to these suppliers in the case of multiple sourcing, multiple products,
	with multiple criteria and with supplier's capacity constraints.
	In this context, suppliers offer price discounts on total business
	volume, not on the quantity or variety of products purchased from
	them. A solution methodology is presented to solve the multi-objective
	model, and the model is illustrated using two numerical examples.},

  abstract = {Ontology is one of the fundamental cornerstones of the semantic Web.
	The pervasive use of ontologies in information sharing and knowledge
	management calls for efficient and effective approaches to ontology
	development. Ontology learning, which seeks to discover ontological
	knowledge from various forms of data automatically or semi-automatically,
	can overcome the bottleneck of ontology acquisition in ontology development.
	Despite the significant progress in ontology learning research over
	the past decade, there remain a number of open problems in this field.
	This paper provides a comprehensive review and discussion of major
	issues, challenges, and opportunities in ontology learning. We propose
	a new learning-oriented model for ontology development and a framework
	for ontology learning. Moreover, we identify and discuss important
	dimensions for classifying ontology learning approaches and techniques.
	In light of the impact of domain on choosing ontology learning approaches,
	we summarize domain characteristics that can facilitate future ontology
	learning effort. The paper offers a road map and a variety of insights
	about this fast-growing field.},
